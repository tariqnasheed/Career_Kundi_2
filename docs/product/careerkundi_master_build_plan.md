# CareerKundi Master Build Plan

**Document type:** Permanent product + engineering operating manual  
**Companion file:** [`docs/product/careerkundi_live_tracker.md`](careerkundi_live_tracker.md)  
**Last architecture update:** 2026-07-11 (UX0-S1)  
**Repo fact rule:** Use `VERIFY_IN_REPO` when a path, hash, endpoint, or test is not verified.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

CareerKundi is a modern AI-powered career, learning, evidence, roadmap, preparation, and opportunity operating system. It helps people understand who they are, what they have done, what they want next, and how to prepare and apply safely.

UI must be planned before more feature work because navigation, page ownership, and user journeys determine which backend modules and APIs are safe to build. Backend and frontend must be linked by domains so every feature has one owner on each side. AI must be governed because LLM output can invent facts, leak context, or take unsafe actions.

This master build plan is the permanent operating manual for architecture, ladder, templates, and anti-drift rules. The separate live tracker is the short GPS file for current slice status.

**Hard rule:** No major feature should be implemented unless it has a defined navigation location, backend owner, frontend owner, API/data contract, permission model, UI states, test journey, evidence file, and commit boundary.

---

## 2. Two-File Operating Model

| File | Role | Update frequency |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/product/careerkundi_master_build_plan.md` | Full architecture and technical operating manual | Only when architecture, ladder, slice cards, major decisions, templates, or product direction change |
| `docs/product/careerkundi_live_tracker.md` | Current GPS: position, next slice, blockers, evidence, commits | Every future CareerKundi slice |

**Rules:**

- Master Build Plan = full architecture and technical operating manual.
- Live Tracker = current GPS position of the project.
- The live tracker is updated every slice.
- The master plan is updated only when the plan changes.
- Future Cursor prompts must read both files before acting.
- No slice is closed unless the live tracker is updated.
- Neither file may contain secrets, tokens, credentials, or raw sensitive user data.
- The live tracker must stay short and operational (readable in under 2 minutes).
- Architecture details belong in the master build plan, not the tracker.

## 3. Research-Backed Engineering Principles

### React UI architecture
**Source:** React official documentation — Thinking in React  
Break UI into a component hierarchy; map UI structure to data model shape; build static UI before complex interactivity; keep state minimal; avoid duplicated derived state; place state at the closest correct owner.

### React Router architecture
**Source:** React Router official documentation — Routing  
Use a planned route hierarchy; use an authenticated layout shell; use nested/layout routes where useful; routes must match product concepts; navigation groups must be predictable.

### Vite build discipline
**Source:** Vite official documentation — Building for Production  
`frontend/dist` is generated build output and must stay ignored/untracked.

### FastAPI modular backend
**Source:** FastAPI official documentation — Bigger Applications  
Use modular packages for large backend areas; use route modules / APIRouter-style organization; keep models, schemas, services, routes, tests, and docs together per domain.

### Accessibility
**Source:** W3C WCAG 2.2  
Perceivable, operable, understandable, robust; keyboard navigation; visible focus states; input labels; clear errors; contrast; responsive layout.

### API security
**Sources:** OWASP API Security Top 10 2023; OWASP Authorization Cheat Sheet  
Every user-owned object route needs object-level authorization; never trust user-controlled IDs; deny by default; authorization must be checked server-side.

### LLM / GenAI security
**Source:** OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications  
Protect against prompt injection and sensitive information disclosure; avoid excessive agency; validate model outputs before use; avoid misinformation; control cost and unbounded consumption; protect tool use.

### AI risk governance
**Source:** NIST AI Risk Management Framework  
Govern, map, measure, manage; require human review for high-impact actions.

### Agentic AI architecture
**Source:** Anthropic — Building Effective Agents  
Start with simple deterministic workflows; use structured LLM calls before autonomous agents; use agents only where flexible reasoning and tool use are truly needed; add human checkpoints for high-impact actions.

### Gemini function calling
**Source:** Google Gemini API documentation — Function Calling  
Prefer structured tool/function calling for model-to-tool workflows instead of loose prose.

### MCP later
**Source:** Model Context Protocol documentation  
MCP may later help connect external tools and data sources, but do not introduce it before core CareerKundi workflows are stable.

- primary action, secondary actions
- backend data source, API endpoints, components used
- loading / empty / error / unauthorized / success states
- mobile behavior, analytics events, browser journey test
- what not to build yet, allowed files, forbidden files, commit boundary

This standard is mandatory for future implementation prompts.

- **Layout:** section forms + template gallery + preview frame + export CTA.
- **MVP:** load, edit, template, preview, save/load, PDF export (CVB-F0–F5).
- **Not yet:** advanced AI rewrite agents.
- **Human review:** export.
- **Browser journey:** template → edit → preview → save → refresh → load → export.

### `/roadmaps` (+ new/:id/tasks)
- **Layout:** list/empty → create → detail timeline → tasks.
- **MVP:** ROAD-F0–F3. Platform-wide (not Graduate-only).
- **Not yet:** full AI roadmap engine / taxonomy intelligence (needs 0051).
- **Browser journey:** create → open detail → complete task → refresh persist.

```

Each module should have: `models.py`, `schemas.py`, `service.py`, `routes.py`, `tests/`, `README.md`.

**Rules:** No random cross-module DB access; use service contracts; every route checks ownership; every LLM output has validation; every high-impact generated artifact preserves provenance.

---

## 20. Backend Module Build Template

For every future backend module define:

- module purpose; owned tables; read/write dependencies
- Pydantic schemas; service functions; route endpoints
- auth/ownership checks; privacy classification; provenance requirements
- migration needed?; tests required; runtime smoke check

## 24. Frontend Architecture

Recommended future structure:

```text
frontend/src/
  app/ routes.tsx providers.tsx layout/
  components/ ui/ layout/ career/ cv/ roadmap/ opportunity/ interview/
  features/ platform/ passport/ cv-builder/ roadmaps/ opportunities/
           interview-studio/ skills/ applications/ education/ public-sector/
  lib/ api.ts auth.ts dates.ts errors.ts
  types/ api.ts platform.ts passport.ts cv.ts roadmap.ts opportunity.ts
  pages/
```

**State:** Move toward this incrementally. Do **not** do a giant frontend rewrite just to match the folder map.

---

## 25. Frontend Feature Build Template

Define for every frontend feature: route; page component; feature folder; shared + feature-specific components; API client methods; types; state categories; loading/empty/error/success; auth/unauthorized; mobile; browser journey; console expectations; `frontend/dist` ignored check.

---

## 26. Frontend State and Data-Fetching Rules

| Category | Examples | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Server data | subjects, goals, CVs | Shared API/query layer |
| Form state | goal title, CV fields | Local / form-library owned |
| UI-only state | sidebar collapsed, modal open | UI store |
| Auth/session | tokens, user | Auth store; no duplication |
| Assistant context | page context | Explicit, redacted |

Derived values must not be duplicated in state. API errors use shared error display. Every page needs loading/empty/error/unauthorized states.

---

## 27. Security / Privacy / Permission Matrix

| Resource | Owner | Read | Write | Auth check | Privacy | Consent/retention | High-impact? | Human review? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| career subject | user | owner | owner | ensure_owned_subject | High | Account retention | No | No |
| career passport | user | owner | owner | ownership | High | User export/delete | No | Claims verify later |
| claim | user | owner | owner | ownership | High | Evidence retention | Yes if verified | Yes to verify |
| source/snapshot | user | owner | system/user | ownership | High | Retention policy | No | Source QA |
| CV | user | owner | owner | ownership | High | User delete | Export yes | Export review |
| roadmap | user | owner | owner | ownership | Medium | — | No | Accept AI plan |
| saved job | user | owner | owner | ownership | Medium | — | No | No |
| interview session | user | owner | owner | ownership | Medium | — | No | Pack quality |
| application draft | user | owner | owner | ownership | High | — | No | Before submit |
| application submission | user | owner | owner+gate | ownership + review gate | High | Audit | **Yes** | **Required** |
| education/migration plan | user | owner | owner | ownership | High | Jurisdiction rules | Yes | Source review |
| billing/subscription | user | owner | billing svc | ownership | High | Legal retention | Yes | Ops |
| notification | user | owner | system | ownership | Medium | Opt-in | No | No |
| assistant context | user | owner | owner | ownership | High | Redact logs | Maybe | Tool use gates |

---

## 28. Agentic AI Architecture

**Deterministic app owns:** authentication, authorization, storage, validation, workflow state, provenance, privacy, billing, exports, notifications, human review gates.

**LLM/AI owns:** summaries, drafts, roadmap reasoning, interview question generation, study material generation, fit analysis, explanations, content transformation.

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Deterministic CRUD |
| 1 | Single structured LLM call |
| 2 | Routed workflow |
| 3 | Evaluator/optimizer |
| 4 | Tool-using workflow |
| 5 | Agent with human checkpoints |

**Rule:** Use the lowest level that can solve the task safely.

---

## 29. AI Feature Build Template

Define: user input; context allowed/forbidden; model/provider; structured schema; tool/function calls; validation; safety checks; source grounding; fallback; cost control; human review; logging restrictions; tests/evals.

---

## 30. AI Evaluation and Quality Gates

Gates: source grounding; schema validity; no hallucinated facts; no generic output; role/pathway specificity; safety/privacy; cost/token budget; human review for high-impact actions.

Apply to: CV generation; roadmap generation; interview pack generation; study material; job fit; application drafts; education/migration guidance.

---

## 31. Analytics and Observability Event Map

| Event | Purpose | Safe metadata | Forbidden | Privacy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| subject_created | Foundation usage | subject_id hash | PII | OK |
| goal_created | Goal adoption | goal_kind, status | raw description optional omit | Prefer omit free text |
| passport_completed | Onboarding | completeness % | raw profile | OK |
| cv_created | CV funnel | template_id | CV body | No body |
| cv_exported | Export funnel | template_id | CV body | No body |
| roadmap_created | Roadmap funnel | pathway_type | free text | Prefer omit |
| roadmap_task_completed | Progress | task_id | notes | OK |
| job_saved | Opportunity funnel | source_site | full JD | No JD dump |
| job_fit_viewed | Fit usage | job_id | scores detail optional | Careful |
| interview_session_started | Prep funnel | role_slug | Q&A text | No Q&A |
| practice_completed | Practice funnel | skill_id | answers | No answers |
| application_draft_created | Apply funnel | draft_id | letter body | No body |
| application_submitted_after_review | Safe apply | draft_id | letter/CV body | No body |

Do not log sensitive raw content.

---

## 32. Testing and QA Strategy

**User-visible:** frontend typecheck/build; lint if configured; local backend+frontend; browser journey; console check; `frontend/dist` ignored check.

**Backend:** targeted tests; migration tests if schema changed; ownership/auth tests; fresh DB runtime when foundation/schema changes.

**AI:** golden examples; adversarial prompts; schema validation; source/freshness; generic-output checks; cost checks.

## 34. Release and Feature Flag Strategy

Levels: hidden route → internal preview → beta → public → deprecated → removed.

Every large feature should show: status label; readiness; known limitations; what is not built yet.

## 37. Pre-Written Technical Execution Blueprint

### Universal Slice Execution Pattern

1. **Preflight** — branch, HEAD, origin/main, cached/staged, working tree; stop if unexpected dirty files.
2. **Read project docs** — live tracker then master plan; confirm phase/slice/next/frozen.
3. **Inspect relevant repo area** — routes, components, API client, types, backend routes/schemas/services/models/tests/migrations.
4. **Define allowed files** — exact paths; avoid generated/frozen areas.
5. **Implement or audit only the requested slice** — no opportunistic work, hidden cleanup, unrelated refactor, or out-of-scope redesign.
6. **Run checks matching risk** — docs-only / frontend-visible / backend-API / schema-migration / AI evals.
7. **Update live tracker** — position, status, files, tests, evidence, commit, next slice.
8. **Produce Desktop evidence file** — timestamp, HEAD, branch, origin comparison, files, tests, browser, git status, verdict.
9. **Stage only approved files** — no `git add .` / `-A`; explicit paths only.
10. **Commit only when acceptance allows** — one slice per commit where possible; verify; push after verification unless paused.

---

## 38. Universal Technical Gate Before Any Feature

Before implementing any feature, define:

```text
Feature / Route / Navigation group / User problem
Backend module owner / Frontend feature owner
Primary models / Primary APIs
Auth requirement / Object ownership rule
Privacy classification / Provenance requirement
AI involvement level
UI components / UI states / Browser journey
Allowed files / Forbidden files / Tests
Evidence file / Commit boundary / Rollback note
```

If missing → `BLOCKED_MISSING_FEATURE_GATE`.

---

## 39. Backend Implementation Template

Target shape:

```text
backend/app/<module_name>/
  __init__.py models.py schemas.py service.py routes.py
  tests/test_<module>_routes.py tests/test_<module>_service.py
  README.md
```

Routes: request/response schemas; auth dependency; ownership check; service call; error model; privacy/provenance; tests.

Services: purpose; inputs/outputs; ownership assumptions; validation; DB reads/writes; side effects; failure behavior.

Schema-changing slices: migration; upgrade path; downgrade or documented no-downgrade; fresh DB check; model/schema alignment tests.

---

## 40. Frontend Implementation Template

Target shape:

```text
frontend/src/features/<feature_name>/
  components/ hooks/ pages/ types.ts api.ts index.ts
```

If current repo does not yet support this, use current structure but document the target.

Every page: route; page component; API methods; types; components; server/form/UI state; loading/empty/error/unauthorized/success; mobile; browser journey.

---

## 41. API Contract Template

```text
Endpoint / Method / Purpose / Auth / Owner check
Request schema / Response schema / Success status
Error cases / Privacy note / Provenance note
Frontend caller / Backend service / Tests
```

Minimum errors: 401, 403, 404, 422, 500 (safe message).

---

## 42. AI Feature Template

```text
AI feature name / User-facing purpose / Input
Allowed context / Forbidden context
Model/provider / Prompt owner / Structured output schema
Tool/function calls / Validation / Evaluator
Fallback / Human review / Cost control / Rate limit

## 44. Key Technical Slice Notes

See Section 43 cards for UX0-S2…ROAD-F3. Additional emphasis:

- **UX0-S2:** backend none; frontend inspect only unless approved.
- **PF11-R1:** verify subjects/goals only; no claims UI creep.
- **CVB-F0 / ROAD-F0:** implementation not allowed.
- **CVB-F4 / ROAD-F2:** ownership checks mandatory on every object route.

---

## 45. Anti-Drift Controls

- Do not jump ahead in the ladder.
- Do not implement before route/backend/frontend/API/test ownership is defined.
- Do not mix unrelated features in one slice.
- Do not repair old frozen systems unless explicitly reactivated.
- Do not add AI agents where deterministic logic is enough.
- Do not create duplicate planning documents.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Do not treat planned features as completed.
- Do not claim browser verification unless a browser journey was actually run.
- Do not claim source-backed facts unless the source was preserved.

Violation → `BLOCKED_SCOPE_DRIFT`.

---

## 46. Slice Acceptance Status

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| PASS_ACCEPTED | Required work done; evidence clean; tests match risk; tracker updated; commit/push verified if required |
| PARTIAL_ACCEPTED_WITH_LIMITATIONS | Usable core; non-blocking limitations documented |
| NEEDS_FIX | Close, but issues must be corrected |
| BLOCKED | Missing dependency, dirty repo, test failure, unknown route/API, migration/auth issue, unclear requirement |
| REJECTED | Violates architecture, scope, safety, data integrity, or product direction |

---

## 47. Recovery Playbook

| Issue | Action |
|---|---|
| Unexpected dirty repo | Stop; capture `git status`; classify; do not destructive-clean |
| Unexpected staged files | Stop; show cached names; unstage only with explicit user-approved narrow command if provided; else block |
| Frontend build failure | Capture error; fix only allowed files |
| Browser journey failure | Capture screenshot/console; fix allowed files or block |
| Backend test failure | Capture failing test; fix allowed files or block |
| Migration failure | Stop; do not force; document; block |
| Push failure | Capture remote error; do not force-push; block |

Rules: stop immediately; no destructive git; capture exact status/error; classify; fix only within allowed files; otherwise mark blocked.

- 0051 → before serious Passport/Roadmap/Opportunity taxonomy intelligence
- 0052 → before deep CV/roadmap personalization and applications depth
- 0053 → before evidence-backed claims/proof workflows
- 0054 → before source-backed Opportunity Intelligence
- 0060 → before mature Interview Studio and proof/badge systems
- 0068 → only after Safe Apply rules and human review gates finalized

---

## 50. Do-Not-Build-Yet Register

- Do not rebuild old 004E Interview Pack.
- Do not revive old Auto Apply / blind auto-apply / autonomous application submission.
- Do not add claims verification without evidence rules.
- Do not add public-sector deadlines without source freshness.
- Do not add migration/visa guidance without jurisdiction/source rules.
- Do not add MCP before core workflows stabilize.
- Do not add full autonomous agents before deterministic workflows and human checkpoints.
- Do not add billing before core MVP value is usable.
- Do not do a giant frontend folder rewrite without a dedicated slice.

---

## 51. Evidence Quality Checklist

Every evidence file should include: timestamp; HEAD before; HEAD after if committed; branch; origin/main comparison; files changed; allowed/forbidden checks; tests + results; browser journey if required; console summary if browser-tested; `frontend/dist` status if build ran; live tracker update status; master plan update status if relevant; commit hash if committed; push verification if pushed; known limitations; final verdict.

---

## 52. Human Review Gates

Required before: committing feature code; pushing feature code; destructive git; editing applied migrations; changing auth/security/privacy/retention; sending emails; submitting applications; claiming verification; exporting final CV/application documents; activating paid billing; enabling autonomous agents.
